-When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

-Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.


*****************
Done:

X - create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. Save it to a variable called topics.

X - make a list to your own liking.

X - take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.

X - use a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.

x - When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

x -Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
    settings.rating = RatingType.pg

x - -This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.

x -Add a form to your page that takes a value from a user input box and adds it to your topics array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.
